# Final Project for CS4460 Introduction to Information Visualization
A visualization built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated with the D3 JavaScript library. 

This visualization takes movie information from 2010-2016 and graphs a scatterplot to see trends with different attributes provided in the movie information.
Every point on the graph depicts a movie, with its color depicting the movie's year. When clicked, each point brings up another graph showing the attributes of the movie in a bar chart.

## To run:
Run the command python -m http.server in the project's terminal, and navigate to the port with localhost in the browser to view the visualization.
